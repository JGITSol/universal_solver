## Vision

Universal Solver aims to be the leading open-source platform for advanced mathematical problem solving, symbolic regression, and AI-driven research workflowsâ€”empowering researchers, educators, and developers with modular, extensible, and collaborative tools.

## Roadmap Overview

### Core Platform & Architecture

- Modular, plug-and-play solvers and agents
- CLI, Python API, and GUI improvements
- Standardized configuration and environment management
- Logging, error handling, and reproducibility
- Distributed/cloud-native execution (mid-term)
- Plugin system for third-party solvers (mid-term)
- Web-based interactive UI/dashboard (long-term)

### AI Models & Integration

- Expand supported models (Ollama, Gemini, Llama 3, etc.)
- Improve prompt engineering and agent voting
- Remote/hybrid model execution (mid-term)
- External API integration (OpenAI, Google, HuggingFace)

### Symbolic Regression & Math Engines

- Enhance KAN and symbolic regression modules
- Integrate new math engines
- Unified benchmarking for all solvers

### Benchmarks, Testing, & Quality

- 100% code coverage for core logic
- Automated regression and boundary testing
- Standardized benchmarking and reporting

### Developer Experience & Documentation

- Improved guides, API docs, and onboarding
- Automated code formatting, linting, and type-checking

### Collaboration & Community

- Collaborative notebook workflows
- Community contribution guidelines
- Public model and benchmark sharing
