# Testing Strategy

## Coverage Goals
- 100% code coverage for core solver logic
- 95%+ coverage for error handling paths
- Automated regression testing for all mathematical transformations

## Test Types
1. **Unit Tests** - Validate individual components
2. **Integration Tests** - Verify agent collaboration
3. **Boundary Tests** - Edge cases and threshold values

## Execution
```bash
# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=math_ensemble_adv_ms_hackaton --cov-report=html

# Generate coverage badge
coverage-badge -o coverage.svg
```

## Validation Criteria
- All solutions must pass answer normalization
- Confidence scores validated against threshold matrix
- Error recovery within 3 retry attempts
