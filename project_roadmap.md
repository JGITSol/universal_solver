# Universal Solver Project Roadmap

---

## Vision

Universal Solver aims to be the leading open-source platform for advanced mathematical problem solving, symbolic regression, and AI-driven research workflows—empowering researchers, educators, and developers with modular, extensible, and collaborative tools.

---

## Roadmap Overview

This roadmap is organized into:
- **Core Platform & Architecture**
- **AI Models & Integration**
- **Symbolic Regression & Math Engines**
- **Benchmarks, Testing, & Quality**
- **Developer Experience & Documentation**
- **Collaboration & Community**
- **Deployment & Productization**

Each area is divided into:
- **Short-term (0–3 months)**
- **Mid-term (3–12 months)**
- **Long-term (1–2 years)**

- Improve CLI and Python API for ease of use
- Standardize configuration and environment management
- Enhance logging, error handling, and reproducibility
- Complete migration of all tests to top-level `tests/` directory for robust CI

### Mid-term
- Support distributed and cloud-native execution
- Implement plugin system for third-party solvers and agents
- Enable dynamic loading and hot-reloading of modules
- Integrate advanced caching and checkpointing mechanisms

### Long-term
- Provide web-based interactive UI/dashboard
- Develop visual workflow builder for custom pipelines
- Enable large-scale, multi-user, collaborative sessions

---

## 2. AI Models & Integration

### Short-term
- Expand Ollama model support and seamless switching between LLMs
- Improve prompt engineering and template management
- Add more agent personalities and voting strategies
- Integrate additional open-source models (e.g., Llama 3, Gemma, Exaone)

### Mid-term
- Support remote and hybrid (local/cloud) model execution
- Integrate external APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Google, HuggingFace) with fallback logic
- Develop automated model selection and ensemble tuning

### Long-term
- Incorporate reinforcement learning for adaptive ensembling
- Enable fine-tuning and continual learning workflows
- Support multimodal reasoning (text, image, math, code)

---

## 3. Symbolic Regression & Math Engines

### Short-term
- Refine KAN-based symbolic regression workflows
- Improve symbolic validation and step-level checking (SymPy, SageMath)
- Add support for more mathematical domains (geometry, calculus, etc.)

### Mid-term
- Integrate additional symbolic math engines (e.g., Mathematica, Maple)
- Develop auto-benchmarking against standard datasets
- Enable symbolic regression for real-world datasets and competitions

### Long-term
- Unified interface for symbolic, neural, and hybrid solvers
- Automated discovery of mathematical laws from raw data
- Real-time symbolic reasoning in collaborative settings

---

## 4. Benchmarks, Testing, & Quality

### Short-term
- Achieve 100% test coverage for core modules
- Automate regression and integration tests for all workflows
- Add property-based and fuzz testing for edge cases
- Enforce linting, formatting, and type-checking in CI

### Mid-term
- Establish benchmark suite for solver/model performance
- Integrate continuous benchmarking and result dashboards
- Support test-driven development for new features

### Long-term
- Community-driven benchmark contributions
- Automated bug triage and root-cause analysis
- Certification program for third-party plugins/solvers

---

## 5. Developer Experience & Documentation

### Short-term
- Expand and update all module-level READMEs
- Develop onboarding and quickstart guides
- Add architecture and design docs (diagrams, API refs)

### Mid-term
- Interactive documentation (Jupyter, Sphinx, MkDocs)
- Video tutorials and example notebooks
- Automated doc generation from code and tests

### Long-term
- In-app documentation and help system
- Internationalization and localization of docs

---

## 6. Collaboration & Community

### Short-term
- Publish contribution guidelines and code of conduct
- Encourage issues, discussions, and PRs from early adopters
- Host regular community calls or office hours

### Mid-term
- Launch public roadmap and voting for features
- Organize hackathons, workshops, and competitions
- Build a core contributor team and mentorship program

### Long-term
- Establish governance model (e.g., steering committee)
- Foster ecosystem of plugins, extensions, and integrations
- Partner with academic and industry organizations

---

## 7. Deployment & Productization

### Short-term
- Provide Docker and cloud deployment templates
- Enable export/import of solver configs and results
- Prepare for PyPI and Conda distribution (once license is set)

### Mid-term
- Launch hosted demo or SaaS version (for non-commercial use)
- Integrate with popular cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- Add authentication and user management for collaborative use

### Long-term
- Enterprise-ready features (RBAC, audit logs, SLA monitoring)
- Marketplace for commercial plugins and premium models
- Support for regulatory compliance (GDPR, FERPA, etc.)

---

## Milestones & Prioritization
- Regularly review and update roadmap based on community feedback and research advances
- Prioritize features that maximize research impact, usability, and openness
- Maintain a balance between cutting-edge research and production stability
