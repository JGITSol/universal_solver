# Universal Solver: Project Motivation & Architecture

---

## Slide 1: The Why — Motivation
- **Modern mathematical research** faces growing complexity: multi-model workflows, symbolic regression, and AI-driven reasoning.
- **Fragmented tools**: No unified platform for integrating SOTA models, symbolic engines, and collaborative research.
- **Goal**: Build a modular, extensible, and reproducible platform for advanced math problem solving, symbolic regression, and benchmarking.
- **Industry Standards**: Full test coverage, type-checking, CI/CD, and modern Python tooling.

---

## Slide 2: Core Features & Design Decisions
- **Ensemble Solver**: Combines LangChain, OpenRouter, Ollama, Google Gemini, and SymPy for robust symbolic math.
- **Symbolic Regression**: Integrates Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks (KAN, via PyKAN) for interpretable regression.
- **Benchmarking**: Supports MATH, GSM8K, ASDiv, SVAMP, MiniF2F, etc. via HuggingFace Datasets.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new models/solvers via plug-and-play modules.
- **Cloud & CLI Ready**: Run locally, on Colab, or cloud (GCP, Azure, Kaggle). Export results to Excel/Parquet.

## Slide 3: Implementation Choices
- **Python 3.8+**: Chosen for ecosystem maturity and library support.
- **PyKAN**: For symbolic regression — interpretable, SOTA, and actively developed.
- **LangChain & OpenRouter**: For chaining LLMs and integrating multiple providers (Llama, Gemini, etc.).
- **Pytest & Coverage**: 100% test coverage, continuous integration, and code quality.
- **Modern Tooling**: Black, isort, mypy, markdownlint, pre-commit hooks.
- **Documentation**: Markdown-first, with rich API docs and usage examples.

## Slide 4: Project Structure & Extensibility
- **clean_code/**: Core pipeline logic (ensemble solver, neuro-symbolic system, visualization, tool integration).
- **KAN/**: KAN/PyKAN integration for symbolic regression.
- **adv_resolver_math/**: Advanced ensemble math solvers, agents, and adapters.
- **tests/**: Pytest-based, 100% coverage, benchmarking, and regression tests.
- **docs/**: API docs, model/solver guides, and usage tutorials.
- **CLI & Notebooks**: For reproducible experiments and collaborative research.

---

## Slide 5: Results & Impact
- **Unified workflow**: From symbolic regression to SOTA LLM-based math problem solving.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new models, datasets, or solvers.
- **Reproducible**: CI/CD, test coverage, and version pinning.
- **Collaborative**: Notebooks and cloud support for team science.
- **Benchmarks**: Competitive results on MATH, GSM8K, and custom tasks.
